## Installation & Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- A local server running the autocorrect and autosuggestion API at `http://localhost:11434/api/chat` (e.g., using a model like `gemma2:2b`).
- Node.js or any static file server (optional for local hosting).

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shamik004/Intelligent-Notepad.git
   cd Intelligent-Notepad
   ```

2. **Serve the Application**:
   - Option 1: Open `index.html` directly in a browser (note: API features require a server).
   - Option 2: Use a local server (e.g., with Node.js):
     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     http-server .
     ```
     Access the app at `http://localhost:8080`.

3. **Set Up the API**:
   - Ensure the autocorrect and autosuggestion API is running locally at `http://localhost:11434/api/chat`.
   - Configure the API to use the `gemma2:2b` model or a compatible alternative.
   - Update the API endpoint in the JavaScript code if necessary.

4. **Test the App**:
   - Open the app in your browser.
   - Start typing to see autocorrect and autosuggestion in action.
   - Use the toolbar to format text, change fonts, or save your notes.

## Usage üìö
